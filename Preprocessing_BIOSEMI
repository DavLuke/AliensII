%%preprocessing for BIOSEMI (.bdf) data. You need MATLAB EEGLAB ERPLAB. You also need BIOSIG extension for EEGLAB (you can install it from
%the extension manager


% Clear memory
clear
% and the command window
clc

%Start EEGLAB
[ALLEEG EEG CURRENTSET ALLCOM] = eeglab;

% Path to the parent folder, which contains the data folders for all subjects (you should add your own paths)
home_path  = 'C:\Users\David\Documents\MATLAB\ERP_8_AliensII\Rawbdf\';
% Path to the folder were you are going to keep the preprocessed files
home_path2  = 'C:\Users\David\Documents\MATLAB\ERP_8_AliensII\Pre_processed\';
%Additional Path to the folder were you keep your scripts
home_path3  = 'C:\Users\David\Documents\MATLAB\ERP_8_AliensII\SCRIPTS';
cd(home_path) % We go to the folder with the data

S=dir('*.bdf'); %select the data (.bdf) files and store the names into S.name
% We open the .bdf file, rereference to the mastoids (you have to do this with BIOSEMI data at this moment) and save the files in a .set file
for i= 1:length(S)
    RR = [home_path S(i).name];
    EEG = pop_biosig(RR, 'ref',[65 66] ,'refoptions',{'keepref' 'off'}); %65 and 66 are the mastoids in my data
    EEG = pop_saveset( EEG, 'filename', ['Raw_set',S(i).name],'filepath',home_path2);%filename is the Raw_set + the original name of the file
